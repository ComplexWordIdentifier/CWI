Team Name: IIIT
System 1 Name: NCC
Description:
Our first system relies on 5 features to classify the given word as simple or complex:
1. Unigram Frequency: We used the Google Books Ngram Viewer to obtain the unigram frequency of the given word.
2. Length: We considered length of the given word as a feature as longer words may look complex.
3. Number of senses: A word with higher number of senses is relatively more ambiguous in comparison to a word with lower number of senses. (obtained using Wordnet)
4. Syllable count: Number of syllables in a word was also considered. This information was obtained from http://www.syllablecount.com/syllables.
5. CD count: The number of films in which the given word had appeared was obtained from the SUBTLEX corpus.

No additional data was used for training apart from the one provided by the organizers. We used Nearest Centroid Classification technique for the classification using Manhattan distance metric.

System 2: NCC2
Description:
System 2 is same as system 1. It differs only in one aspect. The distance metric used in the training algorithm of Nearest Centroid Classification is Seuclidean.
