Team Name: CoastalCPH

System 1 Name: NeuralNet
Description: Extracting a multitude of features (including 
parts-of-speech, frequencies, character perplexity and embeddings), we 
train a deep neural network with 2 hidden layers. The single output 
neuron returns a real value between 0 and 1, and we perform extensive 
experiments to optimise the prediction threshold for the harmonic mean 
of recall and accuracy, cross-validating between data splits and testing 
on the different individual annotations.

System 2 Name: Concatenation
Description: Extracting a multitude of features (including 
parts-of-speech, frequencies, character perplexity and embeddings), we 
train a logistic regression classifier based on the concatenation of all 
individual votings in the training set, such that every instance is seen 
20 times during training. We retrieve the probability outputs from the 
classifier and predict as positive the top decile.
