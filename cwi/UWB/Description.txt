Dear Gustavo,
here is the description of our system.

Title: System Description - CWI SemEval 2016
Team Name: UWB
System 1 Name: All
System 2 Name: Agg

Description of systems:
Both systems are based on a maximum entropy classifier. A lot of 
features were tested during development, but the final system is very 
simple. It uses only one feature - document frequency of words in 
Wikipedia (i.e. this word is in 700 documents out of 10000). The Agg 
system is trained on the aggregated data and the All system is trained 
on the annotations from individual annotators.

Our paper will present the all features we have tested and their 
results. We will discuss why such a simple system works best and also 
some aspects of the task.

I'm looking forward to see the results and systems of other participants.

Best regards,
Michal Konkol
